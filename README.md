# AirFleet
Hi there, I am making this as a way to begin keeping track of my flights on-the-go. Whether you're a pilot in Microsoft Flight Simulator, or one that flies the KDTW-EDDF run in real life, this webapp will be for you. The development is just getting started, so sorry if the functionality is limited, and please send me a message on LinkedIn(pranavshhh), or shuklapr@msu.edu if you have any feature reccomendations.
